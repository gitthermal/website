Hey open-source enthusiastic üëãüèª,

Are you looking for contributing to a new open source project? Or want to get started with _UI technologies like Node.js or SQLite_?

We are developing a [Thermal](https://thermal.codecarrot.net) git graphical user interface; a free, open-source, cross-platform, desktop application, and would love to **count on you as a contributor** to improve our application üôè.

The reason you should contribute to Thermal is because of its wide range of technical aspects.

Contributions to Thermal is not just limited to a single language or technology, it is ‚ö° powered by different tools and languages.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)
* [Nodegit](https://www.nodegit.org/) _(W.I.P)_
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) _(W.I.P)_
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) _(planning)_
* JavaScript
* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
* [Azure Pipelines](https://dev.azure.com/codecarrot/Thermal/_build)
* [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org)
* and more...

### Get started

As the project size grows with each passing day, you might ask yourself, where to get started ü§î? and that a very common question for every newcomer.

There are many ways you can get started, by _writing code_, _logging bugs_, _submitting pull requests_, _reporting issues_, _creating suggestions_, _testing the application_, _improving documentation/blog/release notes_, _spreading a word_.

But before that, I suggest you [download the application](https://thermal.codecarrot.net/download/), **give it a test drive** it will help you to understand, how the application works.

Here's a list of issues and PR with the label **good first issue**

### Pair programming

We also offer üíª [pair programming sessions](https://thermal.codecarrot.net/docs/pair-programming) to the newcomers and community members, if there's something you'd like to work on together.

The best part of open source is the community, and every community is stronger when it works together. To help build the strongest community possible, Thermal is offering [one-hour pair programming sessions](https://calendly.com/codecarrot/thermal) to anyone and everyone in the open-source community.

Want to do a **pair programming, ask questions or just chit-chat** üòé, hit a message in [Thermal Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DcSNmts).

Happy commits üòâ
