A Git commands is a page where you can see all the Git commands run by the [Thermal](https://thermal.codecarrot.net/) application.

We build Thermal with the mission to help developers to use Git in more user friendly way and without any hurdles, but that doesn't means that you should stop using Terminal.

No.... ‚úãüèª

Terminal is the heart of any operating system and by using it you can do lots of magical stuff.

To help you stay connected with Terminal, we provide you **Git Commands**, single place you can see the list of commands run by Thermal behind the scenes.
