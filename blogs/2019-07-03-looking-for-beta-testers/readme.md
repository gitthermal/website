import CalloutBlock from "../../src/components/CalloutBlock.vue"

Hi guys 👋🏻!

I'm creating a new open-source cross-platform desktop application allowing developers to manage their Git repositories at one place by providing a simple to use graphical interface.

![Thermal application design](../../static/images/app-screenshot-2x.png)

<callout-block type="warning">
All features are not available as shown above, they are still under development.
</callout-block>

I would love to get some user feedback and know what you guys think. You can download it from [Thermal website](https://thermal.codecarrot.net/) or click on the link [https://thermal.codecarrot.net/download/](https://thermal.codecarrot.net/download/)

You can also join the [Thermal Discord Server](https://discord.gg/yuK7zfg) to share your feedback.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated, whether that be on the functionality of the app or even just the landing page.

Thanks 🙏🏻!
