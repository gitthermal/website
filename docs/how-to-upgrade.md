# How to upgrade?

Currently, Thermal doesn't have the option to auto-update the application but don't get your hopes down.

We are working on it to [bring that feature to you](https://github.com/gitthermal/thermal/pull/57).

In the mean-time, you can [manually download](/download/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=docs&utm_medium=how-to-upgrade) the latest version of Thermal application.
