This is definitely the most difficult page in the guide to write, but we do feel it’s important. Odds are, you've had problems with some other tool and you're here because you want to know if Thermal can solve your specific problems in better way. That's what we hope to answer for you.

We also try very hard to avoid bias. As the core team, we obviously like Thermal a lot. There are some problems we think it solves better than anything else out there. If we didn’t believe that, we wouldn’t be working on it. We do want to be fair and accurate though. Where other tools like GitHub Desktop and SourceTree offer convenience but only limited extensibility, but there aren’t any other graphical interface providing extreme flexibility approachable.
