> Thermal is an [open source project](https://github.com/gitthermal/thermal) built by core team and contributors. We want to make it easy for anyone to contribute to Thermal.

Welcome, whether you're helping us fix bugs, improve the docs, or spread the word, we'd love to have you as part of the Thermal community.

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code, by logging bugs, submitting pull requests, reporting issues, and creating suggestions.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem inside the application? Have a feature request? Or a suggestion. We want to hear about it! Read more about [reporting issues](/docs/reporting-issue/) to know more about it.

## Pull requests

Check out our [Contributing Guide](/docs/contribution-guide/) for ideas on contributing and setup steps for getting our repositories up and running on your local machine.

*Once your pull request is accepted, you will also get a contributor badge [in discord](https://discord.gg/spyxbGt).*

## Bug hunter

We'll be releasing a canary build soon, which can be downloaded from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gitthermal/thermal/).

_You will also get a bug hunter badge [in discord](https://discord.gg/spyxbGt)._
